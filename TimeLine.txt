1. Setup Swift project. 
  a. Calendar Structure
  b. Input field. 
  c. (Potentially) list of previous calendar events
  d. Make the app a toolbar app (save this for the last step)

2. Backend implementation. Either we send and retreive requests from a server or we locally use Gemini LLM in the app using api key.
3. Have the swift app put the ics file into the users calendar automatically.
